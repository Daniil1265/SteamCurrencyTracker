# Steam Currency Tracker Extension

This browser extension enhances your Steam browsing experience by allowing you to quickly check the price difference between Russian Rubles (RUB) and Kazakhstani Tenge (KZT) through SteamDB. This feature can be particularly useful to verify if you can gift a game.

## How It Works

1. **Navigate to any Steam game page in your browser.**
2. **Click on the "Посмотреть на SteamDB" button** to view a quick comparison of the prices.

3. **View the price difference** in a small table showing only the two main currencies: RUB and KZT.

### Important Note:
If the price difference exceeds approximately 10%, you won't be able to gift the game! During purchase, you might see a message like this:

## Additional Features

The extension also works on sub-pages such as DLCs and editions:
